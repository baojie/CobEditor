2005-06-29(THU):
	BUG Fixes
	* Dragging a package onto another brought up a dialogue box asking "merge or don't merge?",
	  the user has 3 options "yes", "no", and "cancel".  Selecting the "cancel" and "no" did
	  the same thing.  Selecting "cancel" now does not affect the ontology.
	  
	* Hitting enter in either the Username or Password field, will be equivalent to hitting
	  the "OK" button.

	Features Implemented
	* Selecting a term or package, the querying will be run on a seperate thread.
		 Also a progress bar will be displayed.
